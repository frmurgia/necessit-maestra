            <p class="testo"> "Necessità Maestra"Design exercises within digital design interstices"Necessità Maestra"
                (Necessity is the teacher) is a reflection of the great master Leonardo da Vinci which suggests the
                great
                human ability to find solutions in situations of real necessity. The concept of digital design
                interstices
                is very close to that of the Renaissance genius: resolving everyday issues by employing and
                reinterpreting
                available resources.Workshop participants will be catapulted into the simulation of particular
                situations
                and will have to plan the use of digital tools to overcome them. We will discuss and explore together
                the
                narratives that emerge from these opportunities, in order to observe new approaches and new perspectives
                on
                designing communicative solutions.The participants should have their own computer, the ability to use
                software to work on materials such as images, audio, and video, and a great capacity to design outside
                the
                box. </p>
