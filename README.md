# Necessita'-Maestra

## Abstract
### "Necessità Maestra"
*Design exercises within digital design interstices*

"Necessità Maestra" (Necessity is the teacher) is a reflection of the great master Leonardo da Vinci which suggests the great human ability to find solutions in situations of real necessity. The concept of digital design interstices is very close to that of the Renaissance genius: a design approach focused on resolving everyday issues by employing and reinterpreting available resources.
Workshop participants will be catapulted into the simulation of particular situations and will have to plan the use of digital tools to overcome them. We will discuss and explore together the narratives that emerge from these opportunities, in order to observe new approaches and new perspectives on designing communicative solutions.

The participants should have their own computer, the ability to use software to work on materials such as images, audio, and video, and a great capacity to design outside the box. The projects will become the content of an exhibition.

index.html it’s a page that only hold an image preview for each artist, this images are link to each artist html, that you will find in the directory: content >

art pages organized by number 01.html, 02.html, 03.html, and so on...

keep in mind that you’ve 11 images, #1 will be in this case your “about” that links to “nothing.html”

edit nothing.html, when you open this file you’ll see that the website layout is inside <div class=”dsc”> keep it like that and only edit the content inside.
<img> will hold your image preview, you can deleted if you don’t need a top image.

<small> place here your title or headline.
<p> will be the place to write you description, every new <p> it’s a new paragraph.
<br> it’s a line break, you can used for phrasing content.
