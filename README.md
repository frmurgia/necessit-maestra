# Necessita'-maestra

## Abstract

### "Necessità Maestra"
Design exercises within digital design interstices

"Necessità Maestra" (Necessity is the teacher) is a reflection of the great master Leonardo da Vinci which suggests the great human ability to find solutions in situations of real necessity. The concept of digital design interstices is very close to that of the Renaissance genius: a design approach focused on resolving everyday issues by employing and reinterpreting available resources.
Workshop participants will be catapulted into the simulation of particular situations and will have to plan the use of digital tools to overcome them. We will discuss and explore together the narratives that emerge from these opportunities, in order to observe new approaches and new perspectives on designing communicative solutions.
